    "## How to Create a Password Strength Checker?\n",
    "A password strength checker works by understanding the combination of digits, letters, and special symbols you use in your password. It is created by training a machine learning model on a labelled dataset of different combinations of letters and special symbols people use in passwords. The model learns from data about what combinations of letters and symbols can be classified as a solid or weak password.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to create an application to check the strength of passwords, we need to have a labelled dataset about different combinations of letters and symbols. I found a dataset on Kaggle to train a machine learning model to predict the strength of a password. We can use that data for this task. You can download the dataset from here."

Before we start preparing the model, we need to tokenize the passwords as we need the model to learn from the combinations of digits, letters, and symbols to predict the password’s strength.
