## Understanding Web Caching --A simulation

This is a simulation of a web caching system. It is a simple simulation, but it is a good start to understand how web caching works. The simulation is written in Python. The simulation is based on the following assumptions:

  * The web server is a single server, and it is assumed that the server is always available.
  * The web server has a finite number of web pages, and the number of web pages is assumed to be 1000.

### How to run the simulation

1. The simulation is written in Python. You need to have Python installed on your computer. 
2. Make sure to be in the same directory as the server.py and client.py files.
3. Run the server.py file. This will start the web server.
4. Run the client.py file. This will start the client. The client will send requests to the server. The client will also print the results of the requests. The client will send requests until the user cancel the client by pressing Ctrl+C.4
